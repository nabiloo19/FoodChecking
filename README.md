This is a Java Lab Project for Second Year Computer Science Students, Second Semester.											
What the program does is that it allows a CUSTOMER and a CHEF to communicate easily.
                                
You will find the code in the src folder, in which it has two sub-folders.
										                                                           
To run the code, open a new project and create 2 packages.

They must be of the same name as in the code.

For any concerns about the code and/or the program, please contact:
